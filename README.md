# Minesweeper

## Brief description
Minesweeper is a single-player puzzle game where you try to clear a grid filled with hidden mines. Here's how it works:
1. Grid: You play on a grid, which can be different sizes, like 9x9 or 16x16.
2. Mines: Some squares have hidden mines, which are dangerous to click on.
3. Revealing Squares: Clicking on a square shows if it's safe or if there's a mine. If there's a mine, you lose.
4. Numbers: Safe squares will show a number that tells you how many of the adjacent squares have mines.
5. Flags: You can use flags to mark squares you think have mines, helping you avoid them.
6. Winning: The goal is to clear all the safe squares without clicking on a mine.
